Don't worry, there's not a lot to read just yet.

## About this repo
<p>First and foremost, this is a test repository that I've created for one singular purpose; entertainment.
A group of me and my friends have recently started playing Dungeons and Dragons over Discord, and I thought it would be funny to write a small series of short stories based on their travels as they go along. That is ultimately what this repo is going to be; a collection of stories that depict their journey through the world I have created for them, and a chance for others to also enjoy their hilarious adventures.</p>
<p>It also happens to be a good way for me to refresh on some basic coding, and thatâ€™s always a plus!</p>
<p><b>Why English?</b><br>
Well, two of the players in question are from the UK, and it felt more natural to write this in the language that the campaign is taking place in.</p>
